## Kotlin, Practically Speaking

 Falling in love with Kotlin is the easy part. Now you've gotta get practical. You know you want to convert your existing files and introduce new Kotlin-based code, but what are the things you need to know? What are the gotchas?

In this session I talk about the 1.5 years of Kotlin experience we've gained on the Yammer Android team. I talk about how we introduced and got started with Kotlin as well as cover many practical lessons we've learned along the way. If your team has been wanting to get started with Kotlin but hasn't yet made the jump, this is the talk for you!
